Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/honor/ rel=external target=_blank>Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p><p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p><p>The Codio platform can perform automatic plagiarism detection by comparing submitted projects against other students&rsquo; submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.</p><p>In this course, <em>unauthorized aid</em> broadly consists of <em>giving or receiving code to complete assignments</em>. This could be code you share with a classmate, code you have asked a third party to write for you, or code you have found online or elsewhere.</p><p>Authorized aid - which is not a violation of the honor policy - includes
using the code snippets provided in the course materials, discussing strategies and techniques with classmates, instructors, TAs, and mentors. Additionally, you may use code snippets and algorithms found in textbooks and web sources if you clearly label them with comments indicating where the code came from and how it is being used in your project.</p><p>You should restrict your use of code libraries to those specified in the assignment description or approved by the instructor. You can ask for approval via Discord in the course channel, and if granted, this approval is valid for the entire class <em>for the specified assignment</em>.</p><h2 id=standard-syllabus-statements>Standard Syllabus Statements</h2><div class="box notices cstyle info"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div><div class=box-content><p>The statements below are standard syllabus statements from K-State and our program.

Students with disabilities may benefit from services including accommodations provided by the Student Access Center. Disabilities can include physical, learning, executive functions, and mental health. You may register at the <a href=https://k-state.edu/accesscenter rel=external target=_blank>Student Access Center</a> or to learn more contact:</p><ul><li>Manhattan/Olathe/Global Campus â€“ Student Access Center<ul><li><a href=mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu rel=external target=_blank>accesscenter@k-state.edu</a></li><li>785-532-6441</li></ul></li><li>K-State Salina Campus â€“ Julie Rowe; Student Success Coordinator<ul><li><a href=mailto:jarowe@k-state.edu rel=external target=_blank>jarowe@k-state.edu</a></li><li>785-820-7908</li></ul></li></ul><p>Students already registered with the Student Access Center please request your Letters of Accommodation early in the semester to provide adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations. Once SAC approves your Letter of Accommodation it will be e-mailed to you, and your instructor(s) for this course. Please follow up with your instructor to discuss how best to implement the approved accommodations.</p><h3 id=expectations-for-conduct>Expectations for Conduct</h3><p>All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the <a href=http://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/ rel=external target=_blank>Student Judicial Conduct Code</a> as outlined in the Student Governing Association <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/provost/resources/teaching/syllabi-statements/KSU-SGA-By-Laws-Fall-2021.pdf rel=external target=_blank>By Laws</a>, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.</p><h3 id=mutual-respect-and-inclusion-in-k-state-teaching--learning-spaces>Mutual Respect and Inclusion in K-State Teaching & Learning Spaces</h3><p>At K-State, faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and supportive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. K-State courses, labs, and other virtual and physical learning spaces promote equitable opportunity to learn, participate, contribute, and succeed, regardless of age, race, color, ethnicity, nationality, genetic information, ancestry, disability, socioeconomic status, military or veteran status, immigration status, Indigenous identity, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, religion, culture, as well as other social identities.</p><p>Faculty and staff are committed to promoting equity and believe the success of an inclusive learning environment relies on the participation, support, and understanding of all students. Students are encouraged to share their views and lived experiences as they relate to the course or their course experience, while recognizing they are doing so in a learning environment in which all are expected to engage with respect to honor the rights, safety, and dignity of others in keeping with the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p><p>If you feel uncomfortable because of comments or behavior encountered in this class, you may bring it to the attention of your instructor, advisors, and/or mentors. If you have questions about how to proceed with a confidential process to resolve concerns, please contact the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/diversity-inclusion/resources/student-ombudsperson/ rel=external target=_blank>Student Ombudsperson Office</a>. Violations of the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/student-code-of-conduct.html rel=external target=_blank>student code of conduct</a> can be reported using the <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?KansasStateUniv&layout_id=10" rel=external target=_blank>Code of Conduct Reporting Form</a>.

It has been adapted from <a href=https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/ rel=external target=_blank>this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the<a href=https://www.recurse.com/manual rel=external target=_blank>Recurse Center Manual</a>. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.</p></div></div><p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p><p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li><li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li><li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li><li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li><li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li><li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li><li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li><li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li><li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li><li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li><li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&mldr;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li><li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li><li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li><li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li></ul><p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p><h3 id=discrimination-harassment-and-sexual-harassment>Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment</h3><p>Kansas State University is committed to maintaining academic, housing, and work environments that are free of discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment. Instructors support the Universityâ€™s commitment by creating a safe learning environment during this course, free of conduct that would interfere with your academic opportunities. Instructors also have a <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/oie/faqs.html rel=external target=_blank>duty to report</a> any behavior they become aware of that potentially violates the Universityâ€™s policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment, as outlined by <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/policies/ppm/3000/3010.html rel=external target=_blank>PPM 3010</a>.</p><p>If a student is subjected to discrimination, harassment, or sexual harassment, they are encouraged to make a non-confidential report to the Universityâ€™s <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/oie/ rel=external target=_blank>Office for Institutional Equity (OIE)</a> using the <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?KansasStateUniv&layout_id=34" rel=external target=_blank>online reporting form</a>. Incident disclosure is not required to receive resources at K-State. Reports that include domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, should be considered for reporting by the complainant to the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/police/suggest/ rel=external target=_blank>Kansas State University Police Department</a> or the <a href=https://www.rileycountypolice.org/ rel=external target=_blank>Riley County Police Department</a>. Reports made to law enforcement are separate from reports made to OIE. A complainant can choose to report to one or both entities. Confidential support and advocacy can be found with the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/care/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education (CARE)</a>.

OIE also provides a <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/oie/resources.html rel=external target=_blank>comprehensive list of resources</a> on their website. If you have questions about non-confidential and confidential resources, please contact OIE at <a href=mailto:equity@ksu.edu rel=external target=_blank>equity@ksu.edu</a> or (785) 532â€“6220.</p><h3 id=academic-freedom-statement>Academic Freedom Statement</h3><p>Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&rsquo;s mission.</p><p>Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.</p><h3 id=campus-safety>Campus Safety</h3><p>Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives. Current Campus Emergency Information is available at the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/advisories/ rel=external target=_blank>Universityâ€™s Advisory</a> webpage.</p><h3 id=student-resources>Student Resources</h3><p>K-State has many resources to help contribute to student success. These resources include accommodations for academics, paying for college, student life, health and safety, and others. Check out the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/onestop/ rel=external target=_blank>Student Guide to Help and Resources: One Stop Shop</a> for more information.</p><h3 id=student-academic-creations>Student Academic Creations</h3><p>Student academic creations are subject to Kansas State University and Kansas Board of Regents Intellectual Property Policies. For courses in which students will be creating intellectual property, the K-State policy can be found at <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/provost/universityhb/fhxr.html rel=external target=_blank>University Handbook, Appendix R: Intellectual Property Policy and Institutional Procedures (part I.E.)</a>. These policies address ownership and use of student academic creations.</p><h3 id=mental-health>Mental Health</h3><p>Your mental health and good relationships are vital to your overall well-being. Symptoms of mental health issues may include excessive sadness or worry, thoughts of death or self-harm, inability to concentrate, lack of motivation, or substance abuse. Although problems can occur anytime for anyone, you should pay extra attention to your mental health if you are feeling academic or financial stress, discrimination, or have experienced a traumatic event, such as loss of a friend or family member, sexual assault or other physical or emotional abuse.</p><p>If you are struggling with these issues, do not wait to seek assistance.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.k-state.edu/counseling/ rel=external target=_blank>Kansas State University Counseling and Psychological Services</a> offers free and confidential services to assist you to meet these challenges.</li><li><a href=https://www.k-state.edu/lafene rel=external target=_blank>Lafene Health Center</a> has specialized nurse practitioners to assist with mental health.</li><li><a href=https://www.k-state.edu/studentlife rel=external target=_blank>The Office of Student Life</a> can direct you to additional resources.</li><li><a href=https://www.hhs.k-state.edu/familycenter/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State Family Center</a> offers individual, couple, and family counseling services on a sliding fee scale.</li><li><a href=https://www.k-state.edu/care/ rel=external target=_blank>Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education (CARE)</a> provides free and confidential assistance for those in our K-State community who have been victimized by violence.</li></ul><p>For Kansas State Salina Campus:</p><ul><li><a href=https://polytechnic.k-state.edu/studentlife/health/counseling.html rel=external target=_blank>Kansas State Salina Counseling Services</a> offers free and confidential services to assist you to meet these challenges.</li><li><a href=https://www.salina.k-state.edu/student-life/ rel=external target=_blank>The Kansas State Salina Office of Student Life</a> can direct you to additional resources.</li><li><a href=https://www.k-state.edu/oie/documents/SalinaResourceSupportWheel.pdf rel=external target=_blank>The Kansas State Salina Campus</a> offers several services for students, including health services, counseling, and academic assistance.</li></ul><p>For Global Campus/K-State Online:</p><ul><li>K-State Online students have free access to mental health counseling with <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/lafene/programs/myssp.html rel=external target=_blank>My SSP</a> - 24/7 support via chat and phone.</li><li>The <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/studentlife/ rel=external target=_blank>Office of Student Life</a> can direct you to additional resources.</li></ul><h3 id=university-excused-absences>University Excused Absences</h3><p>K-State has a <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/provost/universityhb/fhsecf.html rel=external target=_blank>University Excused Absence policy (Section F62)</a>.
